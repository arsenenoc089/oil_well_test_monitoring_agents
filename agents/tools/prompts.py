CONTEXT_PROMPT = (
    "### Well Configuration and Testing\n"
    "- Wells are horizontal and completed with three zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.\n"
    "- Each zone has its own bottomhole pressure (BHP) sensor, though some may be faulty.\n"
    "- Well tests are typically conducted every 2 to 4 weeks.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Normal Production Behavior\n"
    "- Oil rate normally follows a natural decline curve over time.\n"
    "- Water cut (WCT) gradually increases and may reach 70–80% over the well’s life.\n"
    "- No major drops in oil rate are expected unless due to surface/facility issues.\n"
    "- Zones near the aquifer tend to produce more water.\n"
    "- Water breakthrough can occur due to increased injection from nearby water injectors.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Anomalies\n"
    "An anomaly is defined as any deviation from normal behavior. Examples include:\n"
    "- Sudden changes (increase/decrease) in oil rate, water rate, or BHP.\n"
    "- Sudden WCT spikes.\n"
    "- Interventions like:\n"
    "    - Zonal tests or optimizations (shutting one or more zones).\n"
    "    - Acid stimulations to enhance permeability.\n"
    "    - Changes in water injection rates from neighboring injectors.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Zonal Optimization\n"
    "- A zone may be shut if it performs poorly, e.g., very high WCT.\n"
    "- Decisions depend on trade-offs: high WCT may be acceptable if the oil rate is still significant.\n"
    "- Example: Zone 1 (WCT 20%), Zone 2 (WCT 75%), Zone 3 (WCT 35%) → Zone 2 may be shut.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Acid Stimulation\n"
    "- Performed to dissolve near-wellbore deposits and improve flow.\n"
    "- Typically results in:\n"
    "    - A sharp, temporary increase in oil rate (lasting ~2+ months).\n"
    "    - Increased BHP.\n"
    "    - Variable impact on WCT (slight increase or decrease).\n"
